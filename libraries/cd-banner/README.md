# Banner

## Purpose and Usage
Provides a letterbox image to visually augment pages or separate sections.

- image

Use with cd-caption component for image caption and/or image credits.

Use with cd-bleed component for full viewport width option.

@TODO use srcset with good defaults, and add note about Responsive image module in Drupal and its config.

## Caveats
Image uses object-fit and object-position when supported, otherwise a fallback
technique using absolute positioning and transform is used.
