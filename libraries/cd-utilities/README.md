# Utilities

## Purpose and Usage
Add utility classes to any element for basic control over alignment and certain
styles.

Add to as needed.

## Caveats
Be careful of conflicts with other rules as these use wildcard selectors.
Over time, we might find that some of these don't work well.

### Variants

```
*--align-center
*--align-right
*--float-left
*--float-right
*__image--rounded
