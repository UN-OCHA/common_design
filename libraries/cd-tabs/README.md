# Tabs

## Purpose and Usage
These tabs are for the Drupal logged-in user actions on Nodes (View, Edit,
Delete) and came from the Classy theme, with some adjustments.
This component might be suitable for other tabs or could grow to accommodate
different scenarios. There are tabs on HID too which could helps us align this.

@TODO prefix properly with BEM selectors.
