## Purpose and Usage
Width-restricted long form text and media content.

Also includes an aside element for creating a "faux" column.

## Caveats
`cd-max-width` class controls the width of the relevant elements, for best
readability. Depending on the context, this class may be added to individual
elements or the wrapper div.

The layout rules for `cd-layout-two-col` and the aside come from the base
theme. The parent container div requires class `cd-layout-with-sidebar`

### Variants

```
.cd-content--compact /* On the aside element for a compact sidebar */

```
