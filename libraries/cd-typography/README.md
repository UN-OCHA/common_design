# Typography

## Purpose and Usage
Establishes the basic typographic rules for HTML elements used in content
creation. The markup provides a good sample of various HTML elements and how
they are styled.

## Caveats
@TODO Unsure if this should exist. Maybe it's better to have each element (eg.
blockquote) as its own component? Or include element styles in CD typography?

@TODO The rules for the dl assume a single definition per term. They don't work
well for dt followed by several dd which is a legitimate use case (ex: list of
themes for an article). Use classes instead of generic dl rule with variants
like cd-definition-list--inline-single
