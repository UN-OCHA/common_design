// DEPRECATED: Common Design sub-theme Sass styles
//
// As of CD v7 the Sass files are no longer necessary to re-brand a sub-theme.
//
// This file is retained as a deprecation notice. If you are still using it, we
// recommend moving off of Sass and instead using Drupal libraries to override
// any components you wish to change.
//
// You can change the css/brand.css file to pick colors and specify other
// site-specific values, such as logo width.
//
// Docs on libraries/libraries-override/libraries-extend are available in the
// README and commented-out examples are in the sub-theme .info file.
//
// However, to provide a transition period, the output of this file is still
// recognized by the global-styling library (enabled by default). We've also
// retained the Sass tooling and npm commands for a time, during which you can
// use them to decommission your sub-theme Sass.
//
// If you were using the CD Sass mixins, you can directly reference the copy
// contained in the base-theme by uncommenting this @import statement:
//——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
// @import "../../../contrib/common_design/sass/cd/cd-mixins";
