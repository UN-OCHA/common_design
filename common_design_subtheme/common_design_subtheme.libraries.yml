###
# Default global styles for the sub-theme.
#
# If you want some styles to be included on every page load, either add them in
# css/styles.css or add your own files to the list under "theme"
#
# If you want specific components to apply to your whole site, list them as
# dependencies to this library. An example dependency appears here as a comment.
global-styling:
  css:

#   dependencies:

###
# Define Drupal libraries for your custom components.
#
# These libraries can be referenced in your theme info.yml file to extend or
# override existing base-theme or core Drupal libraries. They can also be
# completely independent and style the custom content of your website, such as
# a custom Paragraph type.
#
cds-header:
  css:
    theme:
      libraries/cd/cd-header/cd-logo.css: {}

###
# Define Drupal libraries for additional webfonts.
#
# They will appear in the sub-theme settings in the Drupal Admin UI. The `label`
# field is a key part of identifying them in the Admin UI.
#
# Example: Arabic font using Dubai.
#
# fonts-arabic:
#   label: Arabic
#   css:
#     theme:
#       css/fonts-arabic.css: {}
