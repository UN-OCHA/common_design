###
# Define the default library for the subtheme. If you want to include other
# libraries by default, add them as dependencies to global-styling.
#
# @see common_design_subtheme.libraries.yml
#
libraries:
  - common_design_subtheme/global-styling

###
# Extend libraries to add site-specific styles to the base-theme components.
# Now, wherever the CD Teaser is used, both the base-theme component and your
# modifications will automatically apply. NOTE: the Drupal library must be
# defined in the libraries.yml file to be used here.
#
# @see common_design_subtheme.libraries.yml

#   common_design/cd-teaser:

###
# Override libraries to replace specific base-theme components. Now, when the
# base-theme component would have been used, instead ONLY yours will apply.
