# Caption

## Purpose and Usage
Provides caption style for images or other elements.

## Caveats
If the component is not in the bounds of the page, left and right padding might be needed so caption is not flush with
edge of viewport when the viewport width is reduced below desktop. 

### Variants

```
none
