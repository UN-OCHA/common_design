# Caption

## Purpose and Usage
Provides image caption and/or image credit style for images or other elements.

## Caveats
There is left and right padding by default. If the component is in the bounds of the `cd-container`, left and right 
padding are set to 0 since the container will provide the padding.

### Variants

```
none
