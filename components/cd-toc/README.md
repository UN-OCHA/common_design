# Table of contents

## Purpose and Usage
A list of links to page headings for on-page navigation. Default behaviour is to grow to fit available content.

## Caveats
Due to the use of the CSS counters, the list items do not indent when wrapped.

### Variants

```css
/* On the ol element. */
.cd-toc__list--roman
```
