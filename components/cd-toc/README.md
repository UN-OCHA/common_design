# Table of contents

## Purpose and Usage
A list of links to page headings for onpage navigation.

Default behaviour is to grow to fit available content. When floated, the width is restricted.

## Caveats
This is currently using cd-utilities for the float rules.
Due to the use of the CSS counters, the list items do not indent when wrapped.

### Variants

```
.cd-toc--float-left
.cd-toc--float-right

// On the ol element.
.cd-toc__list--roman

```
