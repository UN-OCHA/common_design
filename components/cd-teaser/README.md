# Teaser

## Purpose and Usage
Display multiple articles. Each item is a teaser with a title, optional image,
summary text and a link to the full article.

The teaser title and/ or image can be linked, and the read more is optional.

Replace the title heading tag with the semantic level based on the other headings on the page.

@TODO If needed, combine with cd-grid for column layout and make appropriate adjustments.

## Caveats
The image wrapper expands to accommodate the image width, and the content div
width adjusts accordingly.
The max-width of the image container is 24rem.
We can use image styles during implementation so all the images and content
widths will be consistent.

### Variants
Use utility classes, cd-button or cd-read-more component for varied content.
