## Purpose and Usage
Display multiple articles in a list. Each item is a teaser with a title, optional image, summary text and a link to the full article.

The teaser title and or image can be linked, and the read more is optional.

## Caveats

### Variants
Use utility classes, cd-button or read-more component for varied content instead.
