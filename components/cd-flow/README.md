# Flow

## Purpose and Usage
Based on the CubeCSS methodology, this component contains various rules to control vertical rhythm and horizontal padding.

WIP

## Caveats
There is currently no mechanism that allows remove or adjust based on viewport.

### Variants

```
.cd-flow
.cd-bumper
.cd-bumper--rtl

```
