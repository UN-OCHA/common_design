# Bleed

## Purpose and Usage
Enables an element to exceed its containing bounds and expand to fit the width of the viewport.

Test with cd-hero and cd-banner components. In theory, anything container should be able to be made full width 
regardless of its content.

## Caveats
@TODO this needs to be tested and we should find out the pitfalls of using this on [GHO](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/gho-site/pull/15)

### Variants

```
.cd-bleed
.cd-bleed--background-only

```
