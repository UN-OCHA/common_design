# Typography

## Purpose and Usage
Establishes the basic typographic rules for HTML elements used in content creation.
The markup provides a good sample of various HTML elements and how they are styled.

## Caveats
@TODO Unsure if this should exist. Maybe it's better to have each element (eg. blockquote) as its own component?
Or include the element styles in CD typography.
