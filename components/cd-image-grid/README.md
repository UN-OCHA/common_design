# Image grid

## Purpose and Usage
Displays thumbnail images or icons in a grid. 
Differs from other grid layouts because this assumes the images are small (width-restricted to 4rem [64px]) so there are
as many columns as will fit in the available space, before wrapping to a new line.

@TODO would be nice to have a scale variable, to change the 4rem to something else and have the padding adjust appropriately.

## Caveats
None
