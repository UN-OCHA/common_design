# Image grid

## Purpose and Usage
Displays thumbnail images or icons in a grid based on the value of `--cd-grid--item-size`.

Differs from other grid layouts because this assumes the images are small
(width-restricted to 4rem [64px] by default) so there are as many columns as will fit in
the available space, before wrapping to a new line.
