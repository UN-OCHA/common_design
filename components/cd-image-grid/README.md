# Image grid

## Purpose and Usage
Displays thumbnail images or icons in a grid.

Differs from other grid layouts because this assumes the images are small
(width-restricted to 4rem [64px]) so there are as many columns as will fit in
the available space, before wrapping to a new line.

@TODO would be nice to have a scale variable, to change the 4rem to something
else and have the padding adjust appropriately.

## Caveats
None
