# Filter

## Purpose and Usage
Displays multiple and varied form elements like inputs and selects.
Includes a submit button where relevant.

Use with the cd-dropdown component to create a collapsed filter area on mobile.
Due to issues documented on CD-241 the CSS custom property to set the dropdown control needs to be added to the
styles.css and doesn't work when added as part of this component's CSS.
There is a .scss partial provided in this component for ease.

@TODO fix this issue.

## Caveats
