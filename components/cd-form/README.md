# Form

## Purpose and Usage
CSS-only component for basic form element styles.
The current approach is defaulting to browser styles. This means we don't expect
it to look the same across every browser.

Also endeavour to keep this devoid of rules that have implication to layout,
where possible.

This can expand as needed. Currently, there are generic and Drupal-specific
selectors.

@TODO spinner as component.
@TODO reinstate webkit search cancel button (currently disabled in normalise.css line 366)

## Caveats
Possibly too generic. Specify as needed.

### Variants

```
none
