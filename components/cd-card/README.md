## Purpose and Usage
Displays concise information in a clear and visually striking manner, with optional images and call to action elements.

## Caveats
Requires cd-grid component or alternative grid system for layout.

Image uses `object-fit` and `object-position` where supported. An IE11 JS solution is in place to set the image as a 
background image when CSS properties are not supported.

The images have a fixed height of 13rem.

### Variants
Use utility classes, cd-button or cd-read-more component for varied content.
