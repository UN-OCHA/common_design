# Styled list

## Purpose and Usage
A list of content that links to other content pages or external resources, or that lists content to augment material on the page.

- image
- title
- text
- link or button in footer

All elements optional. Title and text can also contain links.
Image can be an SVG icon or img element.

Use with cd-button or cd-read-more for style options in footer.

@TODO review this:
Use with cd-grid for column layout (with limitations)

## Caveats
Unsure whether this should be specifici to the ul element
