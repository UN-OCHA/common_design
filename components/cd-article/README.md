# Article

## Purpose and Usage
Width-restricted long form text and media content.

@TODO add an aside element. Should there be a section element inside an article?

## Caveats
`cd-max-width` class controls the width of the relevant elements, for best readability. 
Depending on the context, this class may be added to individual elements or the wrapper div.

The layout rules for the section and the aside come from the base theme. The parent container div requires class `cd-layout-with-sidebar`
