# Bullet list

## Purpose and Usage
A list of text or links with a chevron icon as bullet.

## Caveats
None

### Variants
The default bullet list uses the SVG element data URI as a background image. This means the fill colour can still be 
edited in CSS.

The other variant `--icon` is when the SVG element markup is added to the list.

```
.cd-bullet-list--icon

```
