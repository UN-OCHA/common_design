# Title list

## Purpose and Usage
A page title for landing pages and article pages, intended for h1 heading.

Use `cd-utilities` component alignment classes to center landing page title if title is short.

## Caveats
Due to Drupal's page rendering order, we use a preprocess function to better control page title rendering. Refer to `common_design.theme`.

### Variants

```
.cd-page-title--landing

```
