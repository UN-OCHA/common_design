# Contributing to the base theme or the Component library

Clone the `common_design` base theme repo and make a [pull request](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/common_design/pulls)
against `main` branch for peer review, or open a github [issue](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/common_design/issues).

The PR should follow the [pull request template](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/common_design/pull_request_template.md)
as appropriate.

An item should be added to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/common_design/CHANGELOG.md) before the PR is
merged to `main`.
