# Contributing to the base theme or the Component library

This is Version 2 of the common_design base theme, currently a WIP.

Due to the necessity of maintaining the current version (common_design `master` branch) for dependency updates for existing implementations, we are working on v2 in a feature branch.

Check out the  `common_design` repo branch `cd-226-design-system` and make PR against this branch for peer review.

When base theme PRs are merged to `cd-226-design-system` branch, a deploy to https://feature.commondesign-unocha-org.ahconu.org happens automatically.

Any config to accompany the v2 base theme work needs to be pushed to `cd-226-design-system` branch on `common-design-site` repo.
