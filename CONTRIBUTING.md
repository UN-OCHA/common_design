# Contributing to the base theme or the Component library

Check out the  `common_design` repo and make PR against this branch for peer review.

When base theme PRs are merged a deploy to https://feature.commondesign-unocha-org.ahconu.org 
happens automatically.

Any config to accompany the base theme work needs to be pushed `common-design-site` 
repo.
